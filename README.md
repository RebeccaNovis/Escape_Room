# Escape_Room
 my individual VR game

The scene you want to start in is called "WelcomeRoom"

 1. I implimented a constant looping ambiance in every room which is attatched to the "creepy ambient" empty object
 2. In the first room, there is a test tube (right now just a cylinder) that plays a mechanic sloshing sound on loop, and changes in volume based on the player's dispace
 3. In the third room (The scene is named "SecondSlotPuzzle." There is art on the left wall in this room as well as a half wall on the right that obscures a purple battery (right now just a rectangle)) When you get close enough to the purple battery, a short jingle plays, signifying that you figured out part of the solution. This sound only plays once, but it is a 3D sound. 
 4. the button in the first room plays a clicking sound when you press it. I have not added this to the rest of the buttons yet.
